MVCexample
==========

To explain about the MVC design pattern, and to show how it can be implemented in Visual C#,
I wrote a tutorial about it. The example app for the tutorial is a calculator app.
The calculator is only for demonstrating the design pattern, so functionality-wise it
is neither useful nor complete.

To read the tutorial, see this page:
